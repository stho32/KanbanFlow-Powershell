        .SYNOPSIS
        Gets all time entries and groups them as report

        .DESCRIPTION
        Sometimes you have to report what your day was like.
        No problem if you used the kanbanflow timer features.
		
		.EXAMPLE
		Get-KBFDayOverview -ApiToken $board -Day ((Get-Date).Date) 
    #>    
    [CmdletBinding()]

    )

        $to      = $from.AddDays(1).AddSeconds(-1)

        $entries = Get-KBFTimeEntry -From $from -To $to -ApiToken $ApiToken
		<# Normally we would have a big amount of api calls to get all the task
		   information we need. Instead we read all tasks of the board to be
		   faster. 
		   This will work for now. Obviously this will become more and more problematic
		   the longer a board lives and the more tasks it contains.
